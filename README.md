### Overview:
AirBnb clone Project is so useful for the developers to start working on it as there are a lot of concepts to digest and understand as a practical work -- and here are we had worked on: 

Creating Classes and Models:
This is done to handle the logic that defines the interprocess comunications betwen deferant parts of the project.

Creating the console application: 
was ultimatly created to get the idea of how backend data is beign handled at the user side,<br> rhis was crated by using the cmd module <br>

CRUD Operations are supported - (Create -Read -Update - Delete)<br>

where a user can create, update, show / list (read) or even destroy any object with its ID and a class name.<br>

how to start it:
-------------------

we start the console by excuting this command:<br>
1- python3 console.py <br>
2- (HBNB) --&gt; start using any of the CRUD operations, (whether if the user needs to create, show, update or delete Objects) <br>

How to use it: 
--------------------

in Interactive mode: <br>

$ ./console.py <br>
(hbnb) help <br>
